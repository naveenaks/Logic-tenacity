Landlord Ravi has built n blocks of building adjacent to each other. He wants to know the largest area that can be formed with the following rule: 1) The area has to consist of building only. 2) The area should be in the form of an rectangle
Help Ravi with the given heights of all the blocks in the row, find the largest area as mentioned above

Here the maximum area is 8.image4*2 = 8

Ravi was able to code this but has made some logical error .Help ravi to find his logical error

#include<stdio.h>
int main() {
    /* Enter your code here. Read input from STDIN. Print output to STDOUT */  
     int n;
    scanf("%d",n);
    int a[n];
     int sum=0,max=0,i,j,k;
    for( i=0;i<n;i++)
        scanf("%d",a[i]);
    for(int i=0;i<n;i++)
    {
        sum=0;
        sum=a[i];
        for( j=0;j<n;j++)
        {
            if(a[j]>=a[i])
            {
                sum+=a[i];
            }
            else
                break;
        }
        for( k=i;k>0;k++)
        {
            if(a[k]>=a[i])
            {
                sum+=a[i];
            }
            else
                break;
        }
        if(sum<max)
            max=sum;
    }
    printf("%d",sum);
}
